# **Motivation**
Everyone in life has their down moments. Whether it is the anxiety of completing a required task before a deadline or you are depressed over the fact that you ended a relationship with a person you really care about. There are also few others who may suffer from psychological issues but due to the fact that our society looks down on mental illnesses they refuse to get help and usually suffer in silence. 

# **Aim**
My partner and I aim to develop an application/website that will help people facing psychological issues to become a bit more relaxed and make their lives more manageable.  We plan to implement this strategy by developing a chatbot that these people can talk to when they are having issues such as a panic attack, compulsive urges, etc as talking to someone tends to calm anyone down when they are under alot of pressure or when they are feeling depressed. We also plan on implementing an information hub that consists of information of medical institutions they can approach to and hotlines they can call.  

# **User Stories**
1. As a student who is facing trouble with exam stress i would like to able to communicate to someone to make my mind of studies.

1. As a student who stuggles with anxiety issues i would like to have a set of contacts I can contact incase I have a panic attack.

1. As a studnet facing addiction problems i would like to have something to track my progress.

1. As an administrator I would like reassure that all information provided to the app is confidential and the user can register an account as an alias.
